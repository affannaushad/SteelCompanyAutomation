A few weeks ago, I was approached by an employee at a major company in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to assist with a data formatting task that would have taken them several days, if not weeks, to complete manually. The task involved processing a large file containing over 10,000 rows of data that needed to be cleaned up and correctly formatted before being outputted to a CSV file.

Project Details
The data provided had several issues:

- The Name column contained initials that needed to be removed.
- The Name column also included job titles and company names, which needed to be extracted and placed into their correct respective columns.

To solve this, I created a blueprint of the data structure and quickly identified all the inconsistencies that needed to be addressed. Using this blueprint, I developed a script to automate the entire process. The script was designed to:

- Identify and remove any unwanted initials from the Name column.
- Extract the Job Title and Company Name from the Name column and correctly place them in their respective columns.

Results
Once the employee ran the script, it transformed days or even weeks of manual labor into a task that was completed in just a few minutes. This solution not only saved them a significant amount of time but also underscored the adage that "time is money."
